"Gemini Search Engine powered by Gemini LLMs"

This project aims to create an end-to-end Gemini search engine leveraging the capabilities of Gemini Language Models (LLMs). Gemini LLMs are state-of-the-art models trained on Gemini, a lightweight, text-focused communication protocol designed for efficiency and privacy.

With this search engine, users can efficiently search for Gemini content while enjoying the benefits of Gemini's privacy-focused architecture. The search engine utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to provide accurate and relevant search results tailored to the Gemini protocol.

To run the project, simply execute the following command:

'streamlit run app.py'

This will launch a Streamlit web application where users can interact with the Gemini search engine, input queries, and explore the results seamlessly

Google Gemini Vision Pro is a cutting-edge tool designed to seamlessly translate images into text. Leveraging advanced image recognition algorithms and the power of Google's Gemini platform, this innovative solution allows users to extract text from images with unparalleled accuracy and speed.
